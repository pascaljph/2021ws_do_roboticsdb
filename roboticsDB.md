### Robot density — key figures

A kind of automation race has started in the world, because automation brings important competitive advantages. It is important for a country to know its state of development in the world in order to identify opportunities to implement automation strategies more effectively. One important indicator for this is robot density. This is calculated from the number of industrial robots in the operational inventory in relation to the number of employees.
This indicator makes it possible to compare nations of different sizes in the global automation race, even if they are of different sizes and the conditions are different in each case.
Below you will find an overview of the regions with the highest robot density and thus the largest sales markets for robots.

## Products and robot types

---

In general, it is not that easy to categorize robots. Each of them has its own unique features, which various robots also share. In the following some important robot types are listed:

### Industrial robots

Industrial robots conist of various axis. Most of the industrial robots have **six axis** (six degrees of freedom), as they are more flexible and perform a broad variety of application.

* Axis 1:
Located at the base of the robot -> move left/right, rotate 180 degree from center
Also called: Motoman: S and Fanuc: J1

* Axis 2:
Responsible for the movement of the lower arm. -> move forward/backward
Also called: Motoman: L and Fanuc: J2

* Axis 3:
Responsible for the upper arm to raise and lower -> move vertical
Also called: Motoman: U and Fanuc: J3 

* Axis 4:
Connection with Axis 5, Positioning end effector and manipulation of the part -> move circular
Also called: Motoman: R and Fanuc: J4 

* Axis 5:
Responsible for the wrist to pitch and yaw -> move up/down
Also called: Motoman: B and Fanuc: J5

* Axis 6:
Wrist of the robot -> move circular (360 degree)
Also called: Motoman: T and Fanuc: J6.

### Delivery robots

A delivery robot come with different shape and sizes. Some robots deliver food and look like carts with wheels other delivery robots look like humans.
Delivery robots enhance the speed of delivery, lower labor costs and reliability.

These robots are also known as autonomous robots:
Autonomous robots operate independently of human operators. These robots are usually designed to carry out tasks in open environments that do not require human supervision

[Example video of a food delivery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13jqscTESNM)

### Logistic robots

[Meet the Robots at Amazon](https://www.youtube.com/watchv=HSA5Bq-1fU4)

<a href="https://ibb.co/qD2kc93"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/D1j5vkH/Robotsatamazon.jpg" alt="Robotsatamazon" border="0"></a>
Amazon provides a good example of how humans and robots can work together harmoniously. In Amazons fulfillment centre robots and people work together to pick, sort and transport packages to get them to their customers on time. Moreover, robots can pick heavy items and bring products directly to employees. Therefore the employees can concentrate on more important task.

80% of the warehouses do not use automation or robotics. But Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) and Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) are one of the fastest growing types of robots for transportation of goods at the moment.

### Collaborative robots

A collaborative robot (cobot) is an industrial robot that works together with humans and is not separated from them in the production process by protective devices.

### Humanoid robots

Tesla is already revealing initial concepts of a humanoid robot that will be able to perform repetitive, tedious and dangerous tasks. Called "Tesla Bot," the robot is expected to be 1.70 m tall, weigh about 56 kg, carry a load of 20 kg and be able to lift nearly 70 kg from its cross.

![Tesla](https://heise.cloudimg.io/v7/_www-heise-de_/imgs/18/3/1/5/6/0/6/6/teslabot-b9999fa31c66f3b2.jpeg?q=85&width=610)

"Atlas" the humanoid robot from Boston Dynamics already shows how far advanced research and this field is. For a better insight you will find below a link to a video in which the current development status of Atlas is presented.

### Pre-Programmed Robots

- Pre programed robots can do work that people would get tired of repeating over and over. These robots never take a lunch break or any break! You might have to repair them once in a while. They also have very good accuracy.These robots can drive cars, make cars and even fix cars.

- Pre-programmed robots operate in a controlled environment where they do simple, monotonous tasks. Examples of a pre-programmed robot would be:

1. a mechanical arm on an automotive assembly line
1. Factory robots
1. The robot mip
1. The cyber knife

### Domestic Robots

In contrast to the other robots already presented in this document, there are some kinds of robot which find use in common households. Most have actually been in use for a few years already and have undergone a lot of changes since their first introduction to the market.

![MowingSucks](https://media.istockphoto.com/photos/man-on-his-knees-with-his-lawnmower-picture-id95263914?b=1&k=20&m=95263914&s=170667a&w=0&h=8CQ8lkOgIHgZpSTCS0c4P7OGr5FLEmE1Fs8esfogg9s=)

These Robots usually take over tasks which tend to be considered boring or repetitive, for example cleaning or landscaping. This has 2 main advantages. Firstly, these tasks are rather simple to automate. Secondly, due to the monotonous nature of these tasks the demand for an automatic solution was rather high.
The first Household Robots therefore took over tasks such as trimming lawns, cleaning pools, or vacuuming rooms.

Over the years, the functionality of these kinds of robots was improved. In the beginning, the robots would follow simple or rather random patterns until they were low on battery or 'considered' their work finished. Nowadays, they can map out certain areas, for example singular rooms or certain areas of lawn, which they will systematically take care of.

![CleaningPlan](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/af/d0/56/afd0569d171da6ee3324e0761891e2c4.jpg)

This allows the robots to be not only more time efficient but often times also more energy efficient.

### Human-Robot Collaboration

The idea of a fully automated “lights-out factory” with no production workers — one requiring only machine programming and maintenance — has proven to be a dead end. So much of what happens in a factory requires human ingenuity, learning, and adaptability. As products have become more varied and customized to local markets and customer needs, the economics of full automation make no sense. The immense engineering costs and time required to bring up a fully automated line for a complex product can never be amortized before the product needs to be changed.

To meet the challenges of the future companies need human-machine interaction through all phases of robotic automation and implementation. This would make for a faster setup, installment, commissioning, programming, operating and maintaining of products.

Human-Robot Collaboration also called "Cobots" show great upsides in virtually every field one could imagine. Cobots enable versatile automation steps and increase productivity as it combines human capabilities with the efficiency and precision of a machine. Because of their integrated sensors, Cobots are able to automate delicate assembly tasks - ranging from assembling automotive transmissions through to inserting rubber plugs or handling flexible parts. But not everything is smooth sailing with Cobots as there are many safety concerns.

![Logo](https://www.goeke-group.com/files/ibg/img/content/loesungen/Robotik/MRK/MRK-Mensch-Roboter-Kollaboration-Zusammenarbeit-Messeauftritt.jpg)

Collaboration inevitably raises safety issues, and European legislation is very careful to promote the protection of workers, elderly and weak subjects as a top priority. End-users, robotics components manufacturers, and system integrators, safety has become a barrier to the promotion and availability of collaborative robotics technology in all domains.
Some barriers are technical and arise to due to the complexity of robotics as reconfigurable systems that can change their behavior over time. Other barriers are non-technical and relate to understanding and correctly applying the current standards and directives to prove compliance. This is especially challenging for smaller companies.
Cobots first have to be extensively trained through Machine Learning Algorithms as they have to learn to react to humans before they can start their work task learning.
