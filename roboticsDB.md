## Markets and market sizes

### Markets
The robotic industry can be divided into industrial and service robotics. 

Industrial robots are defined by their use in a manufacturing environment. Service robots are divided into commercial and personal robotics:
- Commercial service robots are used to perform a service in an industrial environment
- Personal service robots are deployed in private households.

Examples for End-Users of industrial robots

Industrial Robots: Automotive, Food and Beverage, Electronics etc.

Service Robots:   Logistics, Military and Defense, Medical and Healthcare etc.

## Products and robot types

---

### Delivery Robots 
A delivery robot come with different shape and sizes. Some robots deliver food and look like carts with wheels other delivery robots look like humans. 
Delivery robots enhance the speed of delivery, lower labor costs and reliability.

### Logistic robots 
[Meet the Robots at Amazon](https://www.youtube.com/watchv=HSA5Bq-1fU4)

<a href="https://ibb.co/qD2kc93"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/D1j5vkH/Robotsatamazon.jpg" alt="Robotsatamazon" border="0"></a>
Amazon provides a good example of how humans and robots can work together harmoniously. In Amazons fulfilment centre robots and people work together to pick, sort and transport packages to get them to their customers on time. Moreover, robots can pick heavy items and bring products directly to employees. Therefore the employees can concentrate on more important task. 

80% of the warehouses do not use automation or robotics. But Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) and Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) are one of the fastest growing types of robots for transportation of goods at the moment.

### Collaborative robots
A collaborative robot (cobot) is an industrial robot that works together with humans and is not separated from them in the production process by protective devices.

### Humanoid robots

Tesla is already revealing initial concepts of a humanoid robot that will be able to perform repetitive, tedious and dangerous tasks.  Called "Tesla Bot," the robot is expected to be 1.70 m tall, weigh about 56 kg, carry a load of 20 kg and be able to lift nearly 70 kg from its cross. 

![Tesla](https://heise.cloudimg.io/v7/_www-heise-de_/imgs/18/3/1/5/6/0/6/6/teslabot-b9999fa31c66f3b2.jpeg?q=85&width=610)

"Atlas" the humanoid robot from Bosten Dynamics already shows how far advanced research and this field is. For a better insight you will find below a link to a video in which the current development status of Atlas is presented.
